# Baseline models
* to consider the baseline values observed before and after treatment 
    * e.g. endogenous synthesis of cortisol
    * e.g. endogenous biomarker (17-OHP)
* 4 types of methods [[2008_Dansirikul]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10928-008-9088-2)

* individual baseline was derived considering IIV ($η_i$) and the population baseline
* assuming a log-normal distribution of the baseline
* does not require pre-dose measurements
* seen as the gold standard
* independent of the data
* superior to the B2 method

$$baseline_𝑖 = baseline \cdot 𝑒^{𝜂_𝑖}$$

## <kbd>**B2**</kbd>
* estimated $baseline_i$ is informed by
    * the individually observed initial concentration ($baseline_{obs,i}$)
    * the interindividual variability corresponding to the residual variability ($η_i,RV$)

$$𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒_𝑖=𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒_{𝑜𝑏𝑠,𝑖} \cdot 𝑒^{𝜂_𝑖,𝑅𝑉}$$
